            <h3>1. What is HTML?</h3>
            <p>HTML is the hypertext markup language - the language for creating websites or 
            web aplications and structuring the content on them. </br>
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from a local storage and 
            render the documents into multimedia web pages.

           <h3>2. HTML tags and attributes</h3>
           <p>
            HTML tags specify the type of element you are creating and mark both the beginning and the end of the HTML element.
            Depending on the type of element you are creating, different attributes with their values can be assigned to the 
            element within its opening tag. See the below image for a better explanation.

                    <h2>What is CSS and it is used for ?.</h2></br>
                    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
                    CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once .External stylesheets are stored in CSS files
                </p>
                <h2>What is Rules, Declarations and Properties in CSS ?.</h2></br>
                <p>A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block. The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.              The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
                   A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.

                <h2>CSS/ Cascading ?</h2></br>
                <p>Cascading" means that styles can fall (or cascade) from one style sheet to another, enabling multiple style sheets to be used on one HTML document.

<h3>6. What are Box Model, margins, borders and paddings?</h3>
<p>
    The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. <br>
    <img src='boxmodel.jpg' alt='no image found' width="26%">
    Padding - Clears an area around the content of the box. The padding is transparent <br>
    Border - A border that goes around the padding and content of the box <br>
    Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent <br>
</p>
<h3>7. What is a FlexBox?</h3>
<p>
The Flexible Box Module, usually referred to as flexbox, was designed as a one-dimensional layout model, and as a method that  <br>
could offer space distribution between items in an interface and powerful alignment capabilities.
Aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word "flex").
The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items' width/height (and order) to best fill the available space. <br>
A flex container expands items to fill available free space, or shrinks them to prevent overflow. <br>
Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed to the regular layouts. <br>
While those work well for pages, they lack flexibility (no pun intended) to support large or complex applications

        <h3>1. What is refactoring?</h3>
        <p>
        'Refactoring' is the process of changing the syntax of a piece of code. 
        The syntax is the spelling and grammar of a programming language. Your code is written in specific ways, with specific punctuation and rules, in order for the program to be able to carry out its function. For example, a function can be written like so: <br />
        <pre><code>function exampleCode() {                         <br />
        };                                                          </code></pre>                                       
        However, it can also be written like so:                    <br />
        <pre><code>exampleCode = () => {                            <br />                       
        };                                                          </code></pre>               
        Both do the same, but follow different writing rules.       <br /><br />
        Changing the syntax can shorten a piece of code, reducing clutter and increasing readability. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>2. What is indentation?</h3>
        <p>
            'Indentation' is the placement of an empty space in order to shift the position of a line.
            The purpose of this is to increase readability by separating lines that are above and below each other, creating paragraphs.
        </p>
        
        <h3>3. What is meant by DRY, KISS, and Separation of Concerns?</h3>
        <p>
        'DRY' is an acronym for 'Don't Repeat Yourself'. In every case if it is possible to not repeat code, while maintaining the functionality of your code, you should. <br />
        'KISS' is an acronym for 'Keep It Simple, Stupid'. Writing complex code can be fun to write, but a pain when you have to read and understand it. Make your code as simple as it can be. <br />
        The 'Separation of Concerns' is about separating your code into sections. Each of your sections would deal with a different 'concern'. <br /><br />
        All of these ideas are principles that are important to keep in mind when writing your code. In the end it is all about not wasting your own, and others, time.
