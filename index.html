            <p>HTML is the hypertext markup language - the language for creating websites or 
                web aplications and structuring the content on them. </br>
                Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from a local storage and 
                render the documents into multimedia web pages.

                    <h2>What is CSS and it is used for ?.</h2></br>
                    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
                    CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once .External stylesheets are stored in CSS files
                </p>
                <h2>What is Rules, Declarations and Properties in CSS ?.</h2></br>
                <p>A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block. The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.              The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
                   A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.

                <h2>CSS/ Cascading ?</h2></br>
                <p>Cascading" means that styles can fall (or cascade) from one style sheet to another, enabling multiple style sheets to be used on one HTML document.

        <h2>Clean Code</h2>
        <h3>1. What is refactoring?</h3>
        <p>
        'Refactoring' is the process of changing the syntax of a piece of code. 
        The syntax is the spelling and grammar of a programming language. Your code is written in specific ways, with specific punctuation and rules, in order for the program to be able to carry out its function. For example, a function can be written like so: <br />
        <pre><code>function exampleCode() {                         <br />
        };                                                          </code></pre>                                       
        However, it can also be written like so:                    <br />
        <pre><code>exampleCode = () => {                            <br />                       
        };                                                          </code></pre>               
        Both do the same, but follow different writing rules.       <br /><br />
        Changing the syntax can shorten a piece of code, reducing clutter and increasing readability. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>2. What is indentation?</h3>
        <p>
            'Indentation' is the placement of an empty space in order to shift the position of a line.
            The purpose of this is to increase readability by separating lines that are above and below each other, creating paragraphs.
        </p>
        
        <h3>3. What is meant by DRY, KISS, and Separation of Concerns?</h3>
        <p>
        'DRY' is an acronym for 'Don't Repeat Yourself'. In every case if it is possible to not repeat code, while maintaining the functionality of your code, you should. <br />
        'KISS' is an acronym for 'Keep It Simple, Stupid'. Writing complex code can be fun to write, but a pain when you have to read and understand it. Make your code as simple as it can be. <br />
        The 'Separation of Concerns' is about separating your code into sections. Each of your sections would deal with a different 'concern'. <br /><br />
        All of these ideas are principles that are important to keep in mind when writing your code. In the end it is all about not wasting your own, and others, time.
